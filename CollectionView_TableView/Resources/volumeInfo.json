        "description": "oW should coded communication be approached? Is it about prob H ability theorems and bounds, or about algorithms and structures? The traditional course in information theory and coding teaches these together in one course in which the Shannon theory, a probabilistic the ory of information, dominates. The theory's predictions and bounds to performance are valuable to the coding engineer, but coding today is mostly about structures and algorithms and their size, speed and error performance. While coding has a theoretical basis, it has a practical side as well, an engineering side in which costs and benefits matter. It is safe to say that most of the recent advances in information theory and coding are in the engineering of coding. These thoughts motivate the present text book: A coded communication book based on methods and algorithms, with information theory in a necessary but supporting role. There has been muchrecent progress in coding, both inthe theory and the practice, and these pages report many new advances. Chapter 2 cov ers traditional source coding, but also the coding ofreal one-dimensional sources like speech and new techniques like vector quantization. Chapter 4 is a unified treatment of trellis codes, beginning with binary convolu tional codes and passing to the new trellis modulation codes.",

        "description": "Source coding theory has as its goal the characterization of the optimal performance achievable in idealized communication systems which must code an information source for transmission over a digital communication or storage channel for transmission to a user. The user must decode the information into a form that is a good approximation to the original. A code is optimal within some class if it achieves the best possible fidelity given whatever constraints are imposed on the code by the available channel. In theory, the primary constraint imposed on a code by the channel is its rate or resolution, the number of bits per second or per input symbol that it can transmit from sender to receiver. In the real world, complexity may be as important as rate. The origins and the basic form of much of the theory date from Shan non's classical development of noiseless source coding and source coding subject to a fidelity criterion (also called rate-distortion theory) [73] [74]. Shannon combined a probabilistic notion of information with limit theo rems from ergodic theory and a random coding technique to describe the optimal performance of systems with a constrained rate but with uncon strained complexity and delay. An alternative approach called asymptotic or high rate quantization theory based on different techniques and approx imations was introduced by Bennett at approximately the same time [4]. This approach constrained the delay but allowed the rate to grow large.",

        "description": "Error-correction coding is being used on an almost routine basis in most new communication systems. Not only is coding equipment being used to increase the energy efficiency of communication links, but coding ideas are also providing innovative solutions to many related communication problems. Among these are the elimination of intersymbol interference caused by filtering and multipath and the improved demodulation of certain frequency modulated signals by taking advantage of the \"natural\" coding provided by a continuous phase. Although several books and nu merous articles have been written on coding theory, there are still noticeable deficiencies. First, the practical aspects of translating a specific decoding algorithm into actual hardware have been largely ignored. The information that is available is sketchy and is widely dispersed. Second, the information required to evaluate a particular technique under situations that are en countered in practice is available for the most part only in private company reports. This book is aimed at correcting both of these problems. It is written for the design engineer who must build the coding and decoding equipment and for the communication system engineer who must incorporate this equipment into a system. It is also suitable as a senior-level or first-year graduate text for an introductory one-semester course in coding theory. The book U\"Ses a minimum of mathematics and entirely avoids the classical theorem/proof approach that is often seen in coding texts.",

        "description": "Among the topics covered in Codebuster's CPT-4 Outpatient Coding Reference and Study Guide are outpatient guidelines, CPT format and conventions, plus terminology. This study guide assists HIM professionals prepare for professional coding exams such as the CCS, CCS-P, and CPC exams. The text serves as an excellent resource for coders who need to refresh or expand their CPT-4 coding skills. Coders can look up various diagnoses and procedures for the applicable coding guideline, while having access realistic coding scenarios that are likely to be similar to the coding problems experienced on the job. The book covers the surgery section of CPT-4 and Anesthesiology. Each chapter stands on its own; thus, the reader can go through the chapters in any order. There is a chapter-by-chapter analysis of the various body systems based on the surgery section of the CPT coding book. All chapters contain, in addition to the basic coding guidelines, critical coding questions, coding tips, coding examples, as well as a quiz at the end of each chapter. There is also a section on coding from operative reports. The operative reports are categorized by body system. The book is written in a step-by-step format and is very easy to follow. The content has been chosen to for two purposes: 1.Target the most frequently encountered coding situations in the outpatient setting. 2.Provide the knowledge base to master the outpatient coding concepts tested on the CCS Exam. The text has 226 short answer questions (CPT codes), 38 operative reports (ICD-9 and CPT codes), and 23 full medical record case studies (ICD-9 and CPT codes). Each question is highly relevant and reflects a coding situation most hospital-based outpatient coders will face. The text strives to ensure the reader understands every diagnosis and procedure discussed: thorough discussion of symptoms, standard treatment protocols, and medications.Coding examples and quizzes help clarify the information presented. 23 Case Studies have been constructed to mimic real-life outpatient medical records. Apply your knowledge from Chapters 1-15 and the Operative Reports to master coding from medical records. Each Case Study presents a complete medical record with associated ancillary documents. The records will test your ability to code in a live setting. Coders can assess their coding efficiency based on their accuracy and speed, critical for on the job practice and exam preparation. The Answer Key contains the rationale for how all codes were determined for the Case Studies. The text is updated every year to reflect the annual CPT coding changes. Linda Kobayashi, BA, RHIT, CCS, has been a coder and coding manager for almost 20 years. Since 1998, Ms. Kobayashi has owned and operated Codebusters, Inc., a nationwide coding consulting company. Widely regarded as a medical coding and auditing expert, she has conducted workshops on a variety of coding topics, including CCS Exam preparation workshops. Throughout her career the author has remained professionally active, as an AHIMA member as well as a member of her state association, CHIA (California health Information Association). Her formal training includes a teaching credential from California State University Los Angeles, a B.A. degree in English Literature from University of California Los Angeles, an RHIT from AHIMA after completing the RHIT program at East Los Angeles College, and a CCS certificate from AHIMA. Extensive experience as a hands-on coder, auditor and educator, and has given the author the expertise to help coders prepare for the professional coding environment.",

Condition and procedure statements in the exercises reflect the current annual editions of the coding manuals. By completing the exercises, you will expand your medical vocabulary, improve coding skills for the physician's office, and learn to code only what the documentation supports. Also included are the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines for diagnosis coding and reporting by physicians. Learners need current CPT, ICD-9-CM, and HCPCS coding manuals to complete the exercises.
